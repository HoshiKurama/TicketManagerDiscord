#      TicketManager Discord Bot Visual Formats
# ===========================================================
#                   For Advanced Users:
# You are likely well-acquainted with AVC files already. This
# file is misleading. %% represents TEMPLATES and NOT inlines.
# Only specified templates are allowed.
#
#                 For New Users:
# This file lets you change how the Discord bot looks. Please
# note the following information:
#
#  - Values which look like %this% are called templates. These
#    get replaced with the right information at run-time.
#
#  - The bot only looks for certain templates. Adding templates
#    to places where they arenâ€™t expected will be ignored.
#
#  - Each entry in this file specifies which templates
#    are allowed.
#
#  - Templates may be removed if you choose to do so.
#
# Less importantly, TicketManager templates use a different
# format. %% is an inline pattern in the main plugin, which
# operates very differently. Trying to use the same syntax
# between this plugin and that plugin WILL cause undesired
# behaviour.
